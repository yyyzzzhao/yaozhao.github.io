* Staging liver fibrosis, Oct 2017 - May 2018
  * Based on ultrasound images, we applied machine learning to stage liver fibrosis. We extract texture, intensity and wavelet features according to characteristics of liver ultrasound image. Then a sparse representation algorithm was applied to select mast relative features and finally a SVM classifier was used to stage liver fibrosis.
  * As contrast, we transfer a pretrained VGG19 network and replaced the last fully connected layer. Our model is based on tensorflow.
