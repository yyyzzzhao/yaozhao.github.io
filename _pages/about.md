Currently, I am pursuing my M.Eng in Electronic and Communication Engineering (machine learning and deep learning) at Fudan MICCAI lab and it's my last semester in Fudan (expected). Before that, I received my B.A. in Electronic Information Engineering at Hebut University of Technology in 2017. My research interests include: medical image recognization, image generation using GAN and image segmentation.

Now I am looking for a Ph.D position in computer vision or medical iamge processing direction. I have great passion for my research area and expect pushing this field foward.
