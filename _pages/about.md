Currently, I am pursuing my Ph.D. in Information Engineering (deep learning and reinforcement learning) at the CUHK-Sensetime Joint Laboratory. I excelled in my undergraduate finance and banking studies (research in quantitative investment) and received my MPhil in Applied Mathematics (volatility modeling). I have a passion for developing quantitative investment and trading strategies. 

With my understanding of client needs and multidisciplinary background that integrates finance, mathematical modeling, and artificial intelligence, I believe I can make a unique contribution to our community.
